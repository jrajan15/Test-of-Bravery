# Test of Bravery
 
This is a game that I created around 12/2015 during my Freshman year of high school.

How to play:
Click on the dice gif to roll the dice, and the bank button to save your score for the current round.
As you roll, your score for the current round increases, but if you roll a 1, your score for the round is 0.
If you want to save your score for the round, bank your score and you cannot earn more points during that round.
The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by choosing how much risk you're willing to take.
